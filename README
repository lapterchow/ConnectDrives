This script will prompt the user for their username and password and
will then map the drives defined in the script using the specified 
credentials.  This is useful for mapping drives when a computer is not 
joined to a Domain.  The domain name is automatically prepended to the 
username supplied by the user.

If the specified drives are already mapped, they will be disconnected 
before being remapped.  This allows you to easily remap the same drives
with different user credentials if needed.

There is also a button to disconnect the drives.  Useful if this is a 
common shared machine with multiple users, a user can disconnect their
drives before walking away from the computer.  User credentials do not need
to be specified to disconnect drives.
